# Loop Star

### Steps

1. Get main.js to call addNewLI as many times as the number the user inputs. e.g., if the user types a 5 in the input box and hits submit, 5 `li`s should appear.
2. Put any string in the parentheses to `addNewLI`. If you're doing it within the loop, it should add that value as the text for every single one! (Which is probably not what we want.)
3. Instead, is there a way for us to put into the addNewLi function the number of the item on the list? Where are we storing that number?
4. Last step: call `makeLatestLIBold` for every EVEN-numbered list item.
